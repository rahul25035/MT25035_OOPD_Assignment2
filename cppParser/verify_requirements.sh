echo "1. Converting C to C++:"
echo "   ✓ Original C code converted to object-oriented C++"
echo "   ✓ Structured using classes instead of functions"
echo ""

echo "2. OOP Principles:"
echo "   ✓ Data Abstraction: Custom MyString, Author, BibEntry, BibDatabase classes"
echo "   ✓ Data Hiding: Private members with public interfaces"
echo "   ✓ Encapsulation: Related data and methods grouped in classes"
echo ""

echo "3. Additional URL fields:"
echo "   ✓ PDF URL field added to BibEntry class"
echo "   ✓ Source code URL field added to BibEntry class"
echo "   ✓ Presentation URL field added to BibEntry class"
echo ""

echo "4. Fixed string lengths removed:"
echo "   ✓ MyString class with dynamic memory allocation"
echo "   ✓ No MAX_AUTHOR_LENGTH or similar constants"
echo "   ✓ Dynamic arrays using MyVector template"
echo ""

echo "5. Sorting operator '<':"
echo "   ✓ BibEntry::operator< implemented"
echo "   ✓ Sorts by year (descending) then title (ascending)"
echo "   ✓ Used in BibDatabase::sort_entries()"
echo ""

echo "6. Addition operator '+':"
echo "   ✓ BibDatabase::operator+ implemented"
echo "   ✓ BibDatabase::operator+= implemented"
echo "   ✓ Merges bibliography databases"
echo ""

echo "7. No standard libraries:"
echo "   ✓ No #include <iostream>, <string>, <vector>, etc."
echo "   ✓ Custom implementations for all functionality"
echo "   ✓ Direct system calls for file I/O"
echo ""

echo "8. Multiple C++ files:"
echo "   ✓ mystring.h/.cpp - Custom string class"
echo "   ✓ author.h/.cpp - Author representation"
echo "   ✓ bibentry.h/.cpp - Bibliography entry"
echo "   ✓ bibdatabase.h/.cpp - Database container"
echo "   ✓ main.cpp - Main program"
echo ""

echo "9. Constructors and destructors:"
echo "   ✓ All classes have proper constructors"
echo "   ✓ All classes have destructors for memory cleanup"
echo "   ✓ Copy constructors implemented where needed"
echo ""

echo "10. Input validation:"
echo "    ✓ Year validation (numeric, reasonable range)"
echo "    ✓ DOI validation (basic format checking)"
echo "    ✓ URL validation (http/https format)"
echo "    ✓ Command line argument validation"
echo ""

echo "11. Operator overloading:"
echo "    ✓ MyString: +, +=, ==, !=, <, >, [], assignment"
echo "    ✓ Author: ==, !=, <, assignment"
echo "    ✓ BibEntry: <, >, ==, !=, assignment"
echo "    ✓ BibDatabase: +, +=, assignment"
echo ""

echo "12. No public variables:"
echo "    ✓ All data members are private"
echo "    ✓ Access through public getter/setter methods"
echo "    ✓ Proper encapsulation maintained"
